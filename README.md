# IT-5-Applications
This repository documents applications, which are the final compiled realizations of solutions to an IT problem or use case. An application can be standalone or operate as part of a platform, which are a grouping of applications which work together for a common purpose. Applications and platforms are constantly being developed, updated, and phased out and the application landscape changes very rapidly.
